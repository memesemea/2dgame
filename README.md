# 2dgame
I decided I just wanted something simple. Not anything so complex. So my character was just a stickfigure with a slightly thicker body. I also chose the background to be a mountain because I felt like it would be a good fit.
I used Pixilart for my sprites. I used it because I was familiar with this tool and have used it in the past.
I didn't face any challenges importing them. I just imported the files and it worked
